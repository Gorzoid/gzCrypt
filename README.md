# gzCrypt

Encryption library written in C++

## Compilation

Simply create a directory "build" inside the folder and run

```
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

Note: you might need some extra arguments to specify your generator. You can chose to use generator specific build commands.

## Tests

Running tests is also just as simple. Once compiled run `ctest` in the build directory.
